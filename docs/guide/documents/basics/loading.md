# Loading Documents by Id

Documents can be loaded by id from the `IDocumentSession` interface, either one at a time or by an enumerable of id values. The load by id functionality
again supports Guid's, integers, long integers, and strings.

## Synchronous Loading

The syntax is shown below:

<<< @/../src/Marten.Testing/Examples/Load_by_Id.cs#sample_load_by_id

## Asynchronous Loading

TODO(need a sample of async loading)
